## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `go run main.go`

Spins up a localhost page<br>
Open [http://localhost:8088/view/TextEditor] to view it in the browser.

The page reads from a .txt file which you can edit in browser and save<br>

### `go run generator.go`

Literally just outputs in the terminal something you should do from a random set of strings.<br>
Edit the strings in generator.go to make hard life choices a little bit easier
